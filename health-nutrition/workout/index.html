    <h2>Top 5 Workouts for Beginners to Build Strength</h2>
    <p>Starting your fitness journey can feel overwhelming—but the good news is, you don't need fancy equipment or an expensive gym membership to begin building strength. Here are 5 simple yet powerful exercises that are perfect for beginners.</p>

    <h3>1. Bodyweight Squats</h3>
    <p>Squats are excellent for building strength in your legs, glutes, and core. They also help improve your posture and balance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart.</li>
      <li>Lower your body by bending your knees and pushing your hips back.</li>
      <li>Keep your chest up and back straight.</li>
      <li>Return to standing. Aim for 3 sets of 10–15 reps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Push-Ups</h3>
    <p>A classic move to strengthen your chest, shoulders, arms, and core. You can start with wall or knee push-ups if needed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.</li>
      <li>Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.</li>
      <li>Keep your body in a straight line. Push back up to start.</li>
      <li>Do 3 sets of 5–10 reps, increasing over time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Glute Bridges</h3>
    <p>Perfect for activating your glutes and strengthening your lower back.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat on the floor.</li>
      <li>Lift your hips up while squeezing your glutes.</li>
      <li>Pause at the top, then lower back down.</li>
      <li>Perform 3 sets of 10–12 reps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Planks</h3>
    <p>Planks are great for core strength and improving posture and stability.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start on your forearms and toes, with your body in a straight line.</li>
      <li>Engage your core and hold the position without letting your hips sag.</li>
      <li>Start with 20–30 seconds and build up to a minute or more.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Dumbbell Rows (or Water Bottle Rows)</h3>
    <p>If you have dumbbells (or even filled water bottles), rows are a fantastic way to target your back and biceps.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Place one hand and knee on a bench or chair.</li>
      <li>Hold the weight in the opposite hand and pull it toward your ribcage.</li>
      <li>Lower with control. Do 3 sets of 8–10 reps per arm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Final Tips</h3>
    <p>Start slow and focus on proper form. Consistency matters more than intensity at the beginning. Pair your workouts with good nutrition, hydration, and rest for optimal results. You’ve got this!</p>
